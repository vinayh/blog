My academic interests are:

* Computational neuroscience (biologically-plausible computational models)
* Computer science and software engineering (machine learning algorithms, software tooling and open-source ecosystems, functional programming, algorithm theory)

I'm currently trying to learn more about a myriad of areas in neuroscience and mathematics.

More casual interests include:

* Transportation and urban planning
* Linguistics (phonetics, evolutionary)
* Animal rights advocacy

I currently live in Zürich, Switzerland, where I study computational neuroscience at the ETH Zürich/University of Zürich. Please visit the [main site](https://vinayh.com) for a more formal and complete description of my experiences.
