      <description>Note: This isn&amp;rsquo;t the type of post I expected to write when setting up this blog, but given the extraordinarily long hiatus since my last post and nonexistent readership (most posts are primarily written to help me structure my thoughts), it seems as worthy as any.
Moments devoid of thought are often scarce in a world dominated by notifications and messages from seemingly every direction, but I am regularly impressed by their value.</description>

      <description>(This tutorial was first given as a talk at a Michigan Hackers event on 2015-07-23. See my slides here. I have explained the first portion of the content here in more depth.)
I will start by talking about some basics of Clojure, then move onto explaining the fundamental purpose of a backend in web development, and finish with a demo of a simple web app (with complete code) that you can deploy to Heroku with a one-click button or try out on another platform of your choice.</description>

      <title>Git hook to deploy static sites to S3</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly simple process to setup S3 syncing with a static site generator with source that you sync using Git. This will allow you to track revision history on your actual writing of posts, etc. while having the generated site automatically deployed on S3 on each push.
All you really need is:
 A way to upload a folder to S3 (I use the excellent s3cmd) A hook that triggers the upload on every git push  For example, if your static site generator is hugo, with destination dir public (like Hugo by default) and your S3 bucket is called &amp;lt;example_bucket&amp;gt;, create a new shell script called pre-push in the .</description>
