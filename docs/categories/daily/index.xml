      <description>I joined my flatmates for a quick walk in the woods today upon one&amp;rsquo;s invitation, having sequestered myself in the apartment for days without direct sunlight and only the breeze afforded by my window.

      <description>I finally decided to make the trek out of my apartment today to replenish on groceries after more than a week of quarantining myself, and in the midst of widespread self-quarantining to limit spread of the coronavirus.</description>
