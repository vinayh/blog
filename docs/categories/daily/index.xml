      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something rather wonderful about rediscovering a friendship with an old friend or family member that you haven&amp;rsquo;t talked to in a while. It is the fascination of meeting someone new, requiring the unmasking of facets of yourself and the inquiry into theirs, interlaced with the comfort and kinship typically only found in the midst of closer friends, familiar with many of your quirks and interests. It is the amazement of remembeing all that you had forgotten you had in common, the scramble to catch up on whatever you can remember happened in the last few months, and also the occasional feeling of disappointment or angst hearing about an event in another&amp;rsquo;s life that you weren&amp;rsquo;t there for.</description>

      <description>As part of better understanding what types of music fit my various mental states and moods, I have been trying to find music when reading or writing material that requires a little less cognitive load. For more intense tasks, I generally prefer non-lyrical electronic music or revert to eschewing sounds altogether. However, for medium load tasks that are typically less technical or layered in complexity, the unused load creates a void that seems to lead my thoughts astray over a period of time.</description>

      <title>Prioritizing</title>

      <description>How does one even begin to prioritize and choose between longer-term undertakings spanning several months or more? Based on the limited experience of my own life, I find it difficult to place much confidence in my careful rationalizations when evaluating several options, particularly when each contributes to distinct buckets or &amp;ldquo;burners&amp;rdquo;1 in one&amp;rsquo;s life. Not only must I contend with the uncertainty of each option&amp;rsquo;s outcome, but also the expected ancillaries of each as well as their opportunity costs given present alternatives.</description>

      <description>I finally decided to make the trek out of my apartment today to replenish on groceries after more than a week of quarantining myself, and in the midst of widespread self-quarantining to limit spread of the coronavirus. By the standards of any normal day, it would be relatively uneventful and mundane. However, the combination of a looming possibility of catching the most infamous virus in a generation, the ambiance of a city extraordinarily devoid of faces, and my almost total solitude in preceding days made the most mundane of activities such as disembarking from a bus feel surreal.</description>

      <title>Pride</title>

      <description>What is pride? I was in a conversation some few weeks ago with a friend in which they claimed to feel pride because of the country they were from, in contrast to many other places which handled the issue in question differently. At the time, this seemed like a normal turn of conversation, as expressing national pride is anything but uncommon. Later on, however, I started to wonder what this actually implied.</description>

      <description>I started this daily notes sub-blog to have a more frictionless way to post daily thoughts without the commitment of composing a full blog post. The #100Days challenge which requires writing and publishing a post every day for a hundred consecutive days seemed like an appropriate endeavor, particularly in this time of self-quarantining due to the coronavirus which necessitates more solitary activities. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the implications of obligating oneself to capture a fleeting thought and develop it into a coherent narrative, every single day.</description>
