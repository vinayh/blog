		<p>As part of better understanding what types of music fit my various mental states and moods, I have been trying to find music when reading or writing material that requires a little less cognitive load. For more intense tasks, I generally prefer non-lyrical electronic music or revert to eschewing sounds altogether. However, for medium load tasks that are typically less technical or layered in complexity, the unused load creates a void that seems to lead my thoughts astray over a period of time. Some types of music, physical activity, or other occupations with a limited burden seem to mitigate this effect. Non-lyrical music proves insufficient, but songs in languages I can partially understand prove too distracting, so for the past year or so I&rsquo;ve settled on music in languages I don&rsquo;t understand for these settings.</p>
<p>In doing so, I&rsquo;ve explored music from several countries I&rsquo;m not especially familiar with, and while I can&rsquo;t honestly say that my cultural awareness was broadened by listening to songs I don&rsquo;t understand, I also never felt that something was &ldquo;missing&rdquo; because of the unintelligible lyrics. It seems strange that popular music is still often limited to the endemic tongues, particularly in the English-speaking world. Taking a quick glance at current Spotify charts from the UK and the US, the rare non-English song can be found, and only then is in one of the very few other languages to have made any inroads into the mainstream. Things aren&rsquo;t much rosier in many other countries where often only the local languages along with English are represented. In an age dominated by on-demand streaming services far more globalized than their predecessors, such as record shops, it&rsquo;s not clear to me why we haven&rsquo;t seen a stronger renaissance of music that defies linguistic borders. I&rsquo;m not certain of the likelihoods here, but I would surmise that greater dissemination of global music would elicit more identification with foreign artists, and by extension empathy towards the populations they represent.</p>
