		<h3 id="personal-experience">Personal experience</h3>
<p>I recently read this book (<em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion</em> - Jonathan Haidt - 2012) after a long hiatus from reading non-required material, with rare exceptions. As a result, I had little confidence that I could get through it, or any book for that matter. I decided to forge ahead anyway and try the audiobook edition which I had purchased some time ago. Within ten minutes or so, I realized that this book claimed to answer essential questions about morality, ethics, and their implications on modern-day political ideologies that I actually had dying curiosities about. By the end of the book, I realized that I largely got what I was looking for: a framework of thought by which I could empathize with the strengths (I was largely blind to) and articulate the weaknesses (I was too focused on) of political views wildly different than mine. I&rsquo;m not sure if this will spark long-term shifts in my own views, but I feel I am now better equipped to view those with well-founded divergent views from a starting point of goodwill and inquisitiveness rather than assuming faulty reasoning, misinformation, or stubbornness. I can&rsquo;t imagine any of us has all of the answers to a system as complex as modern society, so we would all be well-served by talking to those who have different blind spots from ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="brief-review">Brief review</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend this book enough. It manages to draw from a multitude of sources over millennia to trace a path of moral evolution through changing civilizations, political systems, religions, and more. It pulls one&rsquo;s convictions in personal morals back down to reality by exposing underlying irrationalities and emotion-fueled reasoning while remaining largely politically-agnostic in tone, showing the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of ideologies throughout history. It also demonstrates an asymmetry in modern Western political convictions that I think would be of interest to anyone who (like me) has a challenging time identifying what drives those with differing political views, sometimes resorting to a sense of evil or malevolence on the &ldquo;other side.&rdquo; If you would like a more compassionate outlook on other political views, particularly important if you live in a democracy, I think you will find this book a wonderful experience.</p>
